This program prompts the user to enter any number of sentences, then it uses a regular expression to capture each sentence and repeat them back to the user individually.

Varibales:

    s: Variable s prompts the user to enter sentences and stores the input.

    pat: Variable pat is a regular expression that matches sentences.

    m: Variable m uses the findall method and the pat variable to create a list of sentences from variable s.

Functions:

    main(): Function main() emboidies the entire program.

Steps:

    1. Import regular expressions

    2. Variable s prompts the user to input sentences.

    3. Define variable pat, the regular expression that will be used to capture sentences.

    4. Variable m uses the findall method and the pat variable to create a list of sentences from variable s.

    5. Print a statement notifying the number of sentences found.

    6. Use a for loop to print each sentence individually.
