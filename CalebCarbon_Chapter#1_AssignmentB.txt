This program simulates a Magic 8 Ball, which is a fortune telling toy that displays a random response to a yes or no question.
The program gives a random answer from a file called 8ball_responses.txt and repeats until the user types 'quit'.


Variables:

Variable file represents 8ball_responses.txt.

Variable responses is a list that holds answers from 8ball_responses.txt.

Variable question hold user input.


Functions:

Function main() embodies the entire program


Steps:

Step 1: Import random module.

Step 2: Define and call main() function.

Step 3: Open 8ball_responses.txt in read mode as variable file.

Step 4: Initialize list responses as empty list.

Step 5: Use a for each loop to append every line from 8ball_responses.txt to responses.

Step 6: A while loop begins that will continuously prompts the user to ask questions.

Step 7: Variable question stores user input.

Step 8: Variable question is converted to lowercase.

Step 9: If question is the string 'quit', break the loop. If not, print a random answer from the responses list and repeat the loop.
