This program uses a Deck object to simulate a deck of cards. The main function draws a hand of five cards and gives the user a chance to redraw any of the cards.

Variables:

    ranks: Variable ranks is a list that stores the possible values for a card.

    suits: Variable suits is a list that holds the possible card suits.

    my_deck: Variable my_deck is the Deck object that function main() will use.

    hand: Variable hand is a list that holds 5 cards.

    r: Variable r calculates the rank for a given card

    s: Variable s calculates the suit for a given card

    i: Variable i gets input for which cards to replace.

    d: Variable d creates a list of all single digits in i

Functions:

    discard(): Function discard() takes an integer, adds it to the discards_list, and removes it from the cards_in_play_list.

    main(): Function main() creates a hand of 5 cards, reads it to the user, takes input for cards to replace, and shows the new hand.

Steps:

    Step 1: Function main() creates a Deck object called my_deck.

    Step 2: Variable hand creates a list of five cards drawn from my_deck.

    Step 3: The cards are read to the user.

    Step 4: Variable i gets user input asking which cards to replace.

    Step 5: Variable d creates a list of all single digits from i.

    Step 6: A for loop iterates over d and removes each mentioned card into the discard_list and replaces it with a new draw.

    Step 7: The new hand is printed to the user.
