This program takes a user's input and compares it to a list of 30 known spam keywords.
Then, it informs the user how many spam indicators were found, the likelihood that the input message is spam, and which keywords found indicate spam.


VARIABLES:

    Variable 'flags' is a list that contains 30 known spam keywords as strings.

    Variable 'counter' initializes at 0 and increments by 1 with each spam keyword found in the user input.

    Variable 'used' initializes as an empty list and later populates with found spam keywords.

    Variable 'mail' stores user input to evaluate for spam.

    Variable 'likelihood' evaluates to a string based on the final value of variable 'counter' in order to estimate the likelihood that the user input is spam.

    Variable 'used_string' joins the keywords in variable 'used'.


FUNCTIONS:

    Function 'main()' houses the whole program.


STEPS:

    Step 1: Define and call function 'main()'.

    Step 2: Define variables 'flags', 'counter', and 'used' for later use.

    Step 3: Ask user for input ans store in variable 'mail'.

    Step 4: A for loop checks if the user input contains each keyword in 'flags', and if so, increments 'counter' by 1 and appends the keyword to 'used'.

    Step 5: Variable 'likelihood' evaluates to a string based on the final value of variable 'counter'.

    Step 6: Variable 'used_string' joins the keywords in variable 'used' to a string.

    Step 7: The user is notified how many spam keywords were found, the likelihood that the input message is spam, and which spam indicators were found.
