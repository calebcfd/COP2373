This application is made to pre-sell a limited number of cinema tickets. Each buyer can buy up to 4 tickets.
No more than 20 tickets can be sold total. The user is propted for the desired number of tickets and then the remaining number of tickets is displayed.
This process is repeated until all tickets have been sold. Then it displays the total number of buyers.


Variables:

tickets_sold is an integer that initializes at 0 and acts as an accululator for the program's while loop.

total_sales is an integer that initializes at 0 and increments by 1 each time a sale is made.


Functions:

main() Embodies the entire program and is called once to start the program.


Steps:

Step 1: Main function is defined and called to start the program.

Step 2: The user is prompted to input the number of tickets they would like.

Step 3: Using a try block, the user's input is converted to an integer and an except ValueError statement is used to reject non-integer inputs.

Step 4: An if/else statement determines if the user input is between 1 and 4 and if there are enough tickets remaining.

Step 5: If the user input is acceptable, tickets_sold increases by the number of tickets ordered, total_sales increments by 1, the user is notified, and the while loop repeats.

Step 6: If the user input is an unacceptable integer, the user is notified and the while loop repeats.

Step 7: When tickets_sold reaches 20, the while loop completes and the total number of buyers is output.
