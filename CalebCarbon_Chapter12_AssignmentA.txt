#This program reads data from a csv file as a numpy array. Statistics are caluculated and printed to the user.

Variables:

    reader: Variable reader is a csv reader of the grades file.

    data: Variable data hold the value of the grades file.

    arr: Variable arr is the nump arr of the grades file.

    filt_arr: Variable filt_arr holds all row values as integers.

    exams: Variable exams is a list that holds each exam as another list.

    n: Variable n is the accumlator that counts the number of exams.

    exam_stats: Variable exam_stats holds the values returned by stats().

    all_values: Variable all_values holds all values of all exams.


Functions:

    main(): Function main reads the csv file and converts it to an array. Then, it organizes the data and passes it to the stats() function to perform calculations.
            The stats() function returns the data and it is printed to the user.

    stats(): Function stats() takes a list and returns the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum value, and maximum value of values in that list.


Steps: 

    Step 1: Function main opens a csv reader, reads the values as variable data, and makes a numpy array out of it called arr.

    Step 2: Print the first three rows to the user.

    Step 3: Variable filt_arr holds the exam values and converts them to integers.

    Step 4: Variable exams populates with a list which holds the values of each exam.

    Step 5: A for loop iterates over each exam in exams, calling stats on each one and printing the data to the user.

    Step 6: Variable all_values populates with each value from each exam.

    Step 7: Call stats() on all_values and print statistics to user.
